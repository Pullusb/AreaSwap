# TapTapSwap
Blender addon - Keymap shortcuts to swap some areas of blender

---

### Description  

You'll stop having both outliner and the properties panels on screen when they are one "Tab" away from each other !  

Keymap **Tab** key to super quickly swap between **outliner and properties**.  
Exactly like *Shift+F7* for Property editor and *Shift+F9* for outliner but waaay faster ;)  

You can add the keymap manually the exact same way the addon does [as shown in this french forum](http://blenderlounge.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1446&start=45) (which was the direct source for creating this addon)  

But also:  
Keymap **Z** to swap between **dopesheet and graph editor**. (Hjalti Hjalmarsson idea) 

Keymap **shift+Z** to swap between **timeline and dopesheet** (my idea, hurray !)

Keymap **ctrl+shift+alt+X** to iterate in properties panels tabs (the shortcut is way to complex but it's hard to get free left hand accessible keymapping these days ^^)
  
  
### 1.4 Update (20/03/2017)
new shortcut :
**shift+Z swap timeline/dopesheet**

### 1.2 Update (11/03/2017)
new shortcut :
**ctrl+shift+alt+X iterate swap of properties panels tabs** according to active object type and data availability of this object.


### note
[robert-trirop](https://github.com/robert-trirop) made an addon "[editor switcher](https://github.com/robert-trirop/editor_switcher)" that call a pie menu for switching area (with all area choices), if you want a quick way to change/relocate area, it may be better for you.
